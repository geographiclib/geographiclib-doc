GeographicLib
=============

`GeographicLib <C++/doc/index.html>`_ is a small set of C++ classes for

* geodesic and rhumb line calculations,

* conversions between geographic, UTM, UPS, MGRS, geocentric, and local
  cartesian coordinates,

* gravity (e.g., EGM2008) and geomagnetic field (e.g., WMM2020)
  calculations.

Here is the:

* `library documentation <C++/doc/index.html>`_,
* `main project page <https://sourceforge.net/projects/geographiclib/>`_,
* `git repository <https://github.com/geographiclib/geographiclib>`_,
* `license for the library (MIT) <LICENSE.txt>`_,
* `old home page <oindex.html>`_.

Portions of the library (particularly the geodesic routines) have also
been implemented in other languages.  Prior to version 2.0, all the
implementations were bundled together in the same repository.  Now they
have been separated into separate repositories.
