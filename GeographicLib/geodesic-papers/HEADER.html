   <h3>Scans of old papers on geodesics</h3>
   <p>
     This directory contains scans which fill in some of the gaps in the
     Google Books and other online collections.  It also includes scans of
     those pages in Google Books which are missing or unreadable.  The
     description fields within these pdf files provide full citations and,
     where applicable, give links to the corresponding Google Books.  The
     <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/GeodesicCalculations#TheHistory">
       bibliography for geodesics on an ellipsoid</a>
     contains links to these and many other papers on geodesics.
